# RectanglesFitting
- Organize the maximum number of rectangular objects in the minimal area

A Python tool (with an integrated development environment in Eclipse) arrange a set of rectangles under several limitations, allowing the user to place the pieces in the work area and verify that all the necessary restrictions are fulfilled. This tool allows to create, place and rotate rectangles, always verifying first is there's no overlapping and if it is inside the work area. It has 2 extra commands: UNDO, to undo previous alterations and RESOLVE, to foster an automatic solution for the distribution of the non-placed rectangules.

Understanding how to organize rectangles in a given area and maximize it is a key piece in the industry (e.g.: textiles) to make as many cuts as possible with minimal waste and without overlapping fragments.
